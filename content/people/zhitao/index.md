title: Zhitao Song PhD Student [2021-]
subtitle: Two legs dynamic walking control framework like lizards for quadruped robots.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I am Song Zhitao, PhD student at MAEG, Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am mainly engaged in research on the structural design and optimization of legged robots including quadruped and biped. More specifically, the design part includes structural material selection, transmission mechanism calculation, finite element analysis, manufacturing process improvement, etc. The optimization part is to establish a multidisciplinary optimization model based on the data of different components of the robot under various motion conditions, and to find the optimal solution of the optimization model through some meta-heuristic algorithms to improve the performance of our robots.
