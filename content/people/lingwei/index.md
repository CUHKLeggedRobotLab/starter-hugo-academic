# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: My name is Lingwei Zhang and I am 24 years old. I lives in the Fanling in the northeastern part of Hong Kong and is unmarried. I'm serving in CUHK. I work overtime until 10pm every day to get home. I don't smoke, and the wine is just a taste. Go to bed at 11 p.m. and get 8 hours of sleep every day. Before going to bed, I must drink a glass of warm water, then do 20 minutes of calisthenics, go to bed, and fall asleep immediately. As soon as the sun rises, no fatigue and stress could be left until the next day. Doctors say I'm healthy
